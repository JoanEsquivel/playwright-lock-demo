# Decision log

Short records of the choices behind this framework and kit. Newest last.

## 1. TypeScript by default, JavaScript as a supported variant
**Decision:** Standards and templates are written in TypeScript; the `playwright-architecture` skill ships a JS/JSDoc variant and the scaffold script accepts `--lang js`.
**Why:** Typed fixtures and `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` catch the most common agent mistakes (missing `await`, wrong fixture names) before a browser starts.
**Consequences:** `tsc --noEmit` is part of `pnpm lint`; JSON data files are imported directly (CommonJS runtime, no `"type": "module"`).

## 2. Thin page objects; assertions only in specs
**Decision:** `pages/**` and `api/**` expose locators and actions and return raw results. Every `expect` lives in `tests/**`.
**Why:** A spec should show what is verified without opening other files; page objects stay reusable across positive and negative tests.
**Consequences:** Lint forbids `expect` and the `expect` import in those layers. Readiness is expressed with `waitFor()` inside `waitLoad()`.

## 3. The bridge guard exception
**Decision:** A flow method in `utils/e2e.ts` may contain one `expect` that confirms a page transition, wrapped in `test.step`.
**Why:** Multi-page flows need a hard stop when navigation fails; a `waitFor()` would only time out with a less useful message.
**Consequences:** The guard is documented in-line and is never used to assert a business outcome.

## 4. Page objects and clients are fixtures
**Decision:** Every page object and API client is registered in a fixture file and merged in `fixtures/index.fixtures.ts`; specs never instantiate classes.
**Why:** Tests declare what they need as parameters; wiring changes in one place; `mergeTests` keeps concerns separated.
**Consequences:** Adding a page object without a fixture entry is a rule violation caught by the delete/create checklists.

## 5. API clients return `APIResponse`; zod validates in specs
**Decision:** Clients do not parse or assert. Specs check status, then `expect(body).toMatchSchema(Schema)` and business rules.
**Why:** Keeps clients reusable for negative cases (4xx) and makes contract drift visible with a readable zod error.
**Consequences:** One schema file per resource; the `toMatchSchema` matcher is defined in the fixtures index.

## 6. One agent with preloaded skills
**Decision:** A single `qa-playwright-engineer` agent preloads `playwright-architecture` and `playwright-cli` and routes to task skills. No orchestrator/sub-agent hierarchy.
**Why:** The previous orchestrator + three specialists design duplicated rules in four places, cost extra turns and could not be mirrored to Copilot or Cursor.
**Consequences:** Parallel sub-agents are used only for independent page scans (three or more pages).

## 7. `AGENTS.md` is the portable source of truth
**Decision:** The always-on contract lives in `AGENTS.md`; `CLAUDE.md` imports it; `.github/copilot-instructions.md` points to it; Cursor reads it natively.
**Why:** One file, three tools, no drift.
**Consequences:** Claude-only details stay in `CLAUDE.md` below the import.

## 8. Rules are authored once and mirrored by script
**Decision:** Path-scoped rules live in `.claude/rules/*.md`; `scripts/sync-agent-config.mjs` generates `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` and `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`.
**Why:** Each tool has its own frontmatter (`paths`, `globs`, `applyTo`); generating avoids hand-maintained copies.
**Consequences:** CI fails if generated files are stale.

## 9. Lint is the enforcement layer
**Decision:** Architecture rules that can be expressed as ESLint rules are; a `PostToolUse` hook runs ESLint after edits in Claude Code; the `Lint` workflow blocks merges.
**Why:** Instruction files are context, not enforcement; any tool can ignore them.
**Consequences:** Some rules (live scan before locators, no weakened assertions) remain procedural and are covered by skill checklists.

## 10. Playwright's built-in planner/generator/healer agents are not used
**Decision:** The kit keeps its own skills and uses `@playwright/cli` for live browsing and `--debug=cli` attach sessions.
**Why:** The built-in agents generate a different structure (specs in markdown, flat tests) that conflicts with these standards.
**Consequences:** `playwright-cli install --skills` is the only upstream artifact vendored (`.claude/skills/playwright-cli`).

## 11. Targets are parameters
**Decision:** URLs, credentials, language and package manager are inputs (`.env`, scaffold flags), never constants in skills or templates.
**Why:** The kit must scaffold and maintain frameworks for any application; the example targets exist only to keep this repository runnable.
**Consequences:** `grep` for hard-coded targets is part of the kit's verification.

## 12. Test locks demo: a runner-side shared resource and two documented exceptions

The demo target (GitHub Pages build of TAW) keeps all state in `localStorage`, so nothing on the site is shared between workers. The shared resource for the `lock` demo is therefore the suite's single session file `.auth/user.json`: the setup project writes it as the customer, `tests/e2e/session/customer-account.spec.ts` reads it, and `tests/e2e/session/admin-area.spec.ts` overwrites it with the admin session and restores it. Both groups declare `lock: 'shared-session'`.

Three exceptions to the kit templates are accepted for this repo:

- The kit's decision table prescribes one storage-state file per role. The demo deliberately shares one file between the customer readers and the admin writer, because that shared file is the resource under study. Splitting it per role would remove the race and the demo with it.

- Page-object `url`s have no leading slash (`'account/login'`, `'./'`) because `BASE_URL` includes the Pages sub-path; a leading slash escapes it.
- `tests/demo/race/` holds byte-identical copies of the session specs without `lock`, run only by `playwright.race.config.ts` (`pnpm demo:race`, expected to fail). No project in `playwright.config.ts` points at it, so `pnpm test` never runs the copies, while ESLint and `tsc` still cover them.

## Appendix — tool compatibility matrix

| Artifact | Claude Code | GitHub Copilot (VS Code / CLI / cloud) | Cursor |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | via `@AGENTS.md` in `CLAUDE.md` | native (always-on) | native (always-on) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | native | VS Code reads it | — |
| `.claude/rules/*.md` (`paths`) | native | VS Code reads them; CLI/cloud use the generated `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` (`applyTo`) | generated `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (`globs`) |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | native | native (`.claude/skills` is a supported location) | native (`.claude/skills` is a supported location) |
| Agent | `.claude/agents/qa-playwright-engineer.md` (skills preloaded, project memory) | generated `.github/agents/qa-playwright-engineer.agent.md` | no agent files; `AGENTS.md` + skills cover the role |
| Lint hook | `.claude/settings.json` `PostToolUse` | — (rely on `pnpm lint` and the Lint workflow) | — (same) |
| Enforcement | ESLint gates + CI | ESLint gates + CI | ESLint gates + CI |

Generated files carry a `GENERATED` header; `pnpm sync:agents` rewrites them and `pnpm sync:agents:check` fails CI when they drift.
